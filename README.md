Record List UX Improvements
=

This extension provides a number of UX improvements to the record list and TYPO3 BE in general.

Currently the following features are available:

* Anchor links in web_list view (record list) which allow to jump directly to the respective table
* Prev/next record buttons in record editing view (EditDocumentController) which allow to open the previous or next record of the same kind on the current page
